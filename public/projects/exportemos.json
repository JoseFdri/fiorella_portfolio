    "overview": "Develop a comprehensive UX/UI proposal for PROMPERÚ's new official export portal, with a focus on enhancing communication and information delivery. Prioritize the user experience for exporters, potential exporters, and academics. The proposal will involve user research, navigation architecture, wireframe prototyping, and visual interface design.",
    "problem": "Upon evaluating the original website, we identified serious usability issues and disorganized design that had a negative impact on the user experience. The outdated design and lack of a clear hierarchical structure made it challenging for users to locate information, leading to confusion.",
    "solution": "To tackle these challenges, we propose a comprehensive redesign of the website. Through thorough research, we aim to gain a deep understanding of user needs and expectations. Additionally, we will reorganize the content by establishing clear hierarchies and coherent groupings to enhance user comprehension and deliver a more intuitive and satisfying experience.",
